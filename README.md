Implementation of a General Fuzzy Min-Max Neural Network, based off of the paper: ["General Fuzzy Min-Max Neural Network for Clustering and Classification"](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=846747) by Gabrys and Bargiela.

Contrary to the implementation described in this and other papers, this particular implementation uses an approach leveraging vector and matrix operations provided by the python package [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/), rather than the traditional iterative approach.
